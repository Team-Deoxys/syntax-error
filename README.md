 We made this game to bring back nostalgic feelings from old games like Mario, Pokemon etc. This game is based on Unity Game Engine. The code is written in C# language. 

 The build can be found in Final/New Project 2.exe.
 We have also uploaded the entire unity project along with assets, scripts, scenes etc.
